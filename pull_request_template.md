| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| General       | Code should be self-explanatory.                             | Get a feel of story reading, while going through the code. Use appropriate name for variables, functions and classes. If you are taking more time to understand the code, then either code needs refactoring or at least comments have to be written to make it clear. | YES                      | <li>- [x] yes</li> | <li>- [ ] yes</li> |
| General       | Is this function or class too big? If yes, is the function or class having too many responsibilities? |                                                              | NO                       | <li>- [x] no</li>  | <li>- [ ] no</li>  |
| General       | Does the code follow DRY?: Do not Repeat Yourself            | Is there any redundant or duplicate code? DRY (Do not Repeat Yourself) principle: The same code should not be repeated more than twice. Consider reusable services, functions and components. Consider generic functions and classes. | YES                      | <li>- [x] yes</li> | <li>- [ ] yes</li> |
| General       | Exception handling and cleanup (dispose) resources           |                                                              | YES                      | <li>- [x] yes</li> | <li>- [ ] yes</li> |

| Documentation | Is there any incomplete code? If so, should it be removed or flagged with a suitable marker like ‘TODO’? |                                                              | YES                      | <li>- [x] yes</li> | <li>- [ ] yes</li> |
